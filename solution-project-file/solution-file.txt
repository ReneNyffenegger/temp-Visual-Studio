Solution file structures projects inÂ Visual Studio.

State is saved in two files:
  - .sln file (text-based, shared)
  - .suo file (binary, user-specific solution options)

{ .sln


  Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsPersistSolutionProps
      allows to write non-user-specific solution properties into the solution .sln file.

  Solution properties are a series of property name/value pairs.

  { Body

    The body of an .sln file consists of several sections labeled GlobalSection, like this:



  }

  { Loading a solution

    See: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/extensibility/internals/solution-dot-sln-file?view=vs-2019

  }


}
{ .suo

  The solution user options (.suo) file contains per-user solution options and therefore should not be checked in to source code control.

  The solution user options (.suo) file is a structured storage, or compound, file stored in a binary format.
